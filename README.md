üåü Revolutionizing Heart Disease Prediction with Machine Learning üåü

Heart disease continues to be a leading cause of mortality worldwide, challenging healthcare systems globally. Early detection and accurate prediction of heart disease are crucial for improving treatment outcomes, saving lives, and reducing healthcare costs. Traditional diagnostic methods can be invasive and subjective, but our project harnesses the power of machine learning to predict heart disease non-invasively and effectively.

üîç Project Overview:
Our methodology follows a structured and comprehensive pipeline to ensure the development of a robust prediction model.

1. Data Acquisition:
We sourced our dataset from Kaggle, comprising 1000 samples with 16 features. This two-class dataset, expertly labeled, indicates the presence or absence of heart disease.

2. Data Preprocessing:
Transforming raw data into a clean, usable format is essential. Our preprocessing steps included:
Data Cleaning: Addressing inconsistencies and handling missing values.
Data Transformation: Normalizing, scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
Data Reduction: Employing dimensionality reduction and feature selection to eliminate irrelevant or redundant information.
Effective preprocessing enhances model accuracy, reduces training time, and mitigates issues like overfitting.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
EDA helped us uncover patterns and relationships within the data. Key activities included:
Visualizing Data: Using histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and more to identify trends and outliers.
Summary Statistics: Calculating mean, median, and standard deviation to understand central tendencies and variability.
Correlation Analysis: Using correlation matrices and heatmaps to evaluate relationships between features.
Distribution Analysis: Examining the distribution of key features like smoking, age, and gender to assess their impact on heart disease.

4. Feature Engineering:
Enhancing model performance by creating new, informative features:
Logarithmic Transformation of Blood Pressure: Normalizes distribution and mitigates extreme values.
Composite Feature Creation: Combining features like Cholesterol_BloodPressure to capture combined effects.
Exercise_Stress: Measures stress induced by exercise, indicating heart disease risk.
Cholesterol_Ratio: Ratio of HDL (good) cholesterol to LDL (bad) cholesterol.
Mean Arterial Pressure: Provides insight into overall blood pressure condition.
Risk Score: Derived from multiple factors including age, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure.

5. Machine Learning Models:
We employed various algorithms to build and train our models:
Logistic Regression: A linear model for binary classification tasks.
Decision Trees: Non-linear models that handle both numerical and categorical data.
Random Forests: An ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees and merges their outputs.
Gradient Boosting: An ensemble technique that builds models sequentially, focusing on correcting previous errors.

6. Model Evaluation:
We used metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score to assess our models. The Random Forest model outperformed others, achieving 99% accuracy, making it our top choice due to its robustness and ability to handle large datasets.

üîÆ Conclusion and Future Work:
Our Random Forest model demonstrated exceptional accuracy in predicting heart disease. Moving forward, we aim to:

Expand the Dataset: Integrate additional data from public health databases and electronic health records.
Advanced Modeling Techniques: Use data augmentation methods like SMOTE and GANs.
Ensemble Techniques: Employ stacking to further enhance accuracy.
This project underscores the transformative potential of machine learning in healthcare, offering a non-invasive, efficient alternative to traditional heart disease diagnosis methods.
